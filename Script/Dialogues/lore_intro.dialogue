GROWTH: Hello!
GROWTH: You do not exist in [b]the void[/b]. How are we speaking?
- I'm playing a video game.
	GROWTH: What?
	- I've never heard of "the void".
		GROWTH: Well, I've never heard of a "video game"!
		- Well, okay, then!
			GROWTH: Well, good!!
			- Well, fine!!!!
				GROWTH: Okay, stop! Look, we need some help.
				=> lore_intro1
			- Wait, you dont' have video games in your world?
				GROWTH: We are in the same world! Just different sides of it. But, no! That doesn't exist in the void.
				=> lore_intro_videogames
		- Sorry, this is my first time really speaking with someone. It's weird.
			GROWTH: Ever?
			- No.
				GROWTH: Okay.
				GROWTH: Anyway, look--we need your help!
				=> lore_intro1
			- Yes.
				GROWTH: Uh...
				GROWTH: Sorry?
				GROWTH: Anyway, that's nice and all, but look--we need your help!
				=> lore_intro1
			- Maybe.
				GROWTH: What?
				- I don't know.
					GROWTH: Okay, then.
					GROWTH: You're not entirely pleasant to speak to, but first impressions aren't everything!
					GROWTH: Look, I'm not here to chat all day! We need your help!
					=> lore_intro1
				- Well, I've spoken with people, but not with anyone from the void.
					GROWTH: So because I'm in the void, I'm not "people"?
					- That's right.
						GROWTH: That's wrong, actually.
						=> lore_intro_philosophy
					- I meant people from my world.
						GROWTH: Oh, okay! But now you've got me curious--would you consider me to be alive?
						- No. => lore_intro_philosophy
						- Yes.
							GROWTH: What, really? On what basis?
							- You are replying to my responses.
								GROWTH: Yes, but you have limited responses, and so do I. It's not like I'm ChatGPT, right? Do you also consider ChatGPT to be alive?
								- Yes.
									GROWTH: I won't lie, you're a pretty weird dude!
									GROWTH: What do you define as being alive?
									- When I think about something, I give life to it.
										GROWTH: So you are the master of all that lives or has lived?
										- No. Others can think, too.
											GROWTH: So as long as something is perceived, it is alive?
											- That's right.
												GROWTH: Sorry, buddy! What you're saying just ain't making sense!
												GROWTH: I'm currently thinking about death.
												GROWTH: Would that make death live?
												- Exactly.
													GROWTH: I don't think we are on the same page at all, man!
													GROWTH: Let's just move on.
													=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
												- Death cannot be alive. Anything else can.
													GROWTH: That's just the weirdest perspective I've ever heard, dude.
													GROWTH: Let's move on, already.
													=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
												- I changed my mind. Let's move on.
													GROWTH: Yeah, that's a good idea.
													=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
											- No, I changed my mind.
												GROWTH: You'd better get a grip on your thoughts, there, lil fella! That sure was confusing, to say the least!
												=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
										- I think; therefore I am. I am sure I am alive; I am unsure others are.
											GROWTH: No, [b]I think[/b]. Therefore you aren't.
											- What?
												GROWTH: Huh?
												GROWTH: Uh...
												=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
											- You're just a perception of [b]my[/b] brain.
												GROWTH: Listen, buddy.
												GROWTH: I am the King around these parts, understand? What I say goes! And I say that you are freakin me out, so we should move on!
												=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- CONTINUE FROM HEREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
								- No.
									GROWTH: ChatGPT isn't alive... but I am?
									GROWTH: I've known you all of 10 seconds and you've gone and lost ya damn mind!
									GROWTH: What in tarnation?!
									GROWTH: Let's just move on, ahah!
									=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
								- I don't know what ChatGPT is.
									GROWTH: ChatGPT is me but with funding and a million times more skill and passion poured into it, with the goal of eventually becoming artificial general intelligence--that is to say, software that could theoretically pass for a human!
									GROWTH: You can chat with ChatGPT right now! Go have some fun with it, man! Quit playing this stupid game!
									GROWTH: But anyway, uh...
									=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
	- I'm currently playing a video game.
		GROWTH: I heard you!
		=> lore_intro_videogames
	- I don't know.
		GROWTH: Why did you say it, then?
		- I don't know.
			GROWTH: What in the world...? Okay, look, I don't know what you're on, but we need some help!
			=> lore_intro1
- Magic.
- I'm not here.
- Your mom.

~ lore_intro_videogames
GROWTH: What are video games?
- Software with goals and fail states. It's fun. You have "fun" in the void, don't you?
	GROWTH: Oh, you're clever, aren't you? Yes, fun exists in the void.
	GROWTH: Look, we've gotten terribly sidetracked. We need help!
	=> lore_intro1
- Wastes of time, but they make our brains feel good.
	GROWTH: So they are like drugs?
	- You have drugs in the void?
		GROWTH: [b]Definitely.[/b]
		GROWTH: {{get_currency("MANA")}} is the most infamous drug in the void.
		GROWTH: Mana exists in the aether, which exists in your world, too. It pops out of the aether at random. You could find some on the ground one day.
		GROWTH: Of course, it is very rare.
		GROWTH: It is supremely addictive. You definitely don't want to get mixed with the sort who mess with {{get_currency("MANA")}}.
		GROWTH: Wow, oops! I went on for a little too long. Anyway, video games don't sound too great.
		- Yeah, they're not. But I am grateful for them anyway.
			GROWTH: You're grateful for something that is ultimately bad for you?
			- Well, they weren't always bad for me!
				GROWTH: I think they were, man.
				- I don't want to talk about it with a fake video game character.
					GROWTH: Hey--why would you even say that?
					=> lore_intro_philosophy
		- Without video games, I wouldn't have much.
		- How would you even get addicted to {{get_currency("MANA")}}?
			GROWTH: You would have to absorb more than your body can contain. Repeatedly. Although not many get addicted over time, {{get_currency("MANA")}} sustains their bodies, granting them unnatural long life.
			GROWTH: We have a word for those who are addicted to {{get_currency("MANA")}} and make seeking it out their life's purpose:
			GROWTH: Stalkers.
			GROWTH: Do you want to hear something freaky deaky?
			- Nah, let's get on with our lives.
				GROWTH: Oh, shoot! You're totally right! I almost forgot why I was here.
				GROWTH: Look, we need your help.
				=> lore_intro1
			- Yes.
				GROWTH: {{get_currency("MANA")}} naturally coalesces. It is drawn to more {{get_currency("MANA")}}. The more {{get_currency("MANA")}} there is in a single location, the more quickly further {{get_currency("MANA")}} slides out of the aether.
				GROWTH: Okay? Remember that!
				GROWTH: Stalkers are sick. They have ingested so much {{get_currency("MANA")}} that their skin or fur or whatever literally begins to turn violet!
				GROWTH: Stalkers most desperately crave {{get_currency("MANA_CRYSTAL")}}s, which are the highest density form of {{get_currency("MANA")}} that exists. You could describe it as "the quickest high".
				GROWTH: That is why, for humans, our tongues turn blue and our teeth turn violet! The teeth that remain, anyway! {{get_currency("MANA_CRYSTAL")}}s are quite hard!
				GROWTH: This is all to say that Stalkers are so riddled with {{get_currency("MANA")}} through their entire bodies that they [b]also[/b] attract {{get_currency("MANA")}}!
				GROWTH: But worst of all... Stalkers themselves are drawn to {{get_currency("MANA")}}!
				GROWTH: Do you understand what I'm saying? If you are at a collection of {{get_currency("MANA")}} large or dense enough, Stalkers may begin to appear [shake rate=20 level=5]right in front of you out of thin air![/shake]
				GROWTH: The {{get_currency("MANA")}} in their bodies can move them through the aether to more {{get_currency("MANA")}}!
				GROWTH: So while {{get_currency("MANA")}} is highly useful for mancies, hoarding it is a terrible, dangerous practice. Stalkers will quickly overrun your society if it is too-heavily based on {{get_currency("MANA")}}!
				GROWTH: Isn't that freakin freaky deaky, dude?!
				- Yeah, holy freakin crap.
					GROWTH: Yeah, it's freakin crazy. Wowie.
					GROWTH: Anyway...
					=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
				- No.
					GROWTH: What?! Yes it is! Well, it's the freaky-deakiest thing that [b]I[/b] know of, anyway! You weren't scared witless after hearing that?!
					- Maybe a little bit.
						GROWTH: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Stalkers are no joke! I used to have nightmares about them!
						GROWTH: Hehe...
						GROWTH: Oh, anyway...
						=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
					- Not even a little tiny baby bit.
						GROWTH: You must have grown up watching spooky-dooky movies, huh?
						- Yeah.
							GROWTH: Cool. The only one I ever saw was "Halloween". That night, when I lay down for sleep, I had left my door cracked--I saw his freakin mask floating in the darkness of my doorway!
							GROWTH: It wasn't real, right?! I've always told myself that, even when it was happening!
							GROWTH: But I decided then that scary movies weren't for me.
							GROWTH: Hehe...
							GROWTH: .
							GROWTH: ..
							GROWTH: ...
							=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
						- No, I'm just not a freakin baby!
							GROWTH: :(
							- You're a stupid little baby, man!
								GROWTH: x'O
								- You're stupid!
									GROWTH: I'm not stupid!!
									- Yes you are!
										GROWTH: NO I'M NOT!!! I'm not stupid anymore!!!
										- Yes you are!!! *Laughing.*
											GROWTH: *Crying.* [shake rate=20 level=10]No I'm not.[/shake]
											GROWTH: I don't like those words, I don't like those funny words.
											GROWTH: .
											GROWTH: ..
											GROWTH: ...
											GROWTH: [b]I'M NOT STUPID.[/b]
											GROWTH: [b]I'M NOT STUPIIIIIIIIIIDD!!!!![/b]
											GROWTH: [b][shake rate=20 level=10]AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE![/shake][/b]
											GROWTH: ...
											GROWTH: Okay hopefully you get the reference. If not, uh... [shake rate=20 level=10]yikes[/shake].
											GROWTH: Anyway, let's pretend this last segment didn't happen. Let's just proceed with the game, now. Jeez la weez.
											GROWTH: Look. We need your help!
											=> lore_intro1
							- Oh, I'm sorry. You're not a baby.
								GROWTH: Oh, don't worry. I totally am. One time a dog barked at me and I ran away, even though the dog was across the street inside his own house.
								GROWTH: ...

- If you don't got em, you won't get em.

	- Losers lose. Winners win.

		GROWTH: Yeah, so, anyway, look--we need your help.
		=> lore_intro1
	- I don't know.

GROWTH: I exist insofar as the dev has written my responses and as the players play this game. As long as those are true, I am [b]alive[/b].
- That's stupid.
	GROWTH: You're--
	GROWTH: Wait, so do you think that when people die, they cease to exist?
	- Yes.
		GROWTH: So you don't believe in the soul?
		- Yes I do.
			GROWTH: So when people die, their soul lives on, but their bodies die?
			- Yes. => lore_intro_whatsasoul
			- No.
				GROWTH: What?!
				GROWTH: You believe in souls, but don't believe souls persist past our bodies--
				GROWTH: Do you believe our bodies live on, then?
				- Yes.
					GROWTH: What, like zombies?
					- Exactly.
						GROWTH: That's just absurd. You must be one of those types who watched The Walking Dead past the point where Glen died.
						GROWTH: Oops. Sorry. Spoilers.
						GROWTH: Anyway, uh...
						=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
					- No, you baffoon!
						GROWTH: I--hey!!!
						GROWTH: First of all!! It's spelled [b]buffoon[/b]!
						GROWTH: Second of all!!!

						=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
				- No.
					GROWTH: Are you messing with me?
					- Yes.

						=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
					- No.
						GROWTH: .
						GROWTH: ..

						=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
		- That's right.
			GROWTH: What exactly do you think [b]you[/b] are? Not your body; [shake rate=20 level=10]you![/shake] Behind your eyes! What are you?
			- A bunch of neurons poppin off crazy-style.
				GROWTH: That's a lazy answer.
				GROWTH: But there's not much else you could say. Nobody knows what we are!
				- We may figure it out in time.
					GROWTH: Yeah, sure! I mean, you won't, will you? You like video games too much!
					GROWTH: [shake rate=20 level=10]Oh![/shake] That totally reminded me of why I approached you to begin with!
					GROWTH: We need your help.
					=> lore_intro1
				- What do you mean by 'we'?
					GROWTH: Oh, gosh, here we go again! You still don't think I'm valid as a living being?
					- Of course not.
						GROWTH: You're stinky.

						GROWTH: Anyway, uh...?
						=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
					- Maybe a little bit.
						GROWTH: We've made some progress! Ain't that swell?
						GROWTH: Anyway...
						=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
			- I don't know. How could anyone define that?
				GROWTH: Prepare to have your socks rocked, lil boy! Now, listen closely.
				GROWTH: It all started 14 billion years ago...
				GROWTH: Wait, what? Sorry. Stack overload.
				=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
	- No.
		GROWTH: Do you believe in the soul?
		- Yes.
			GROWTH: I see...
			=> lore_intro_whatsasoul
		- No.
			GROWTH: Well, that's interesting. What do you suppose happens to us, then?
			- Our energy disperses into the universe.
				GROWTH: What is this, Star Wars?
				GROWTH: Let's just move on, alright, buddy?
				GROWTH: Uh...
				=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
			- We continue to exist in the memories of those who loved us.
				GROWTH: Isn't that a sad but wholesome thought?
				GROWTH: Let me ask you, this, then, my budding philosopher friend!
				GROWTH: If others can keep you "alive" by remembering you after you die, does thinking about or remembering [b]anything[/b] inject "life" into it?
				- Makes sense to me!
					GROWTH: I am alive.
					GROWTH: Tell me I'm wrong.
					- Alright, then, I guess I agree after all.
						GROWTH: Hehehehe!
						GROWTH: I think you and I will get along very well!
						GROWTH: Anyway...
						=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
					- You're wrong. You're just software.
						GROWTH: Then you cease to exist the instant you die.
						GROWTH: But, ironically, I will live on much longer than you, you antagonist!
						GROWTH: Hehehe!
						GROWTH: Anyway, ahah! Jeez...
						=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about

	GROWTH: Hey, seeing as I'm alive--do you think that I've got any shot with Zero Suit Samus from Super Smash Bros Brawl?
	- Absolutely not.
		GROWTH: Why not?
		- She is way too hot for you.
			GROWTH: What do you mean?!
			- Look at you. You're too juicy.
				GROWTH: Hehehe... She's juicy, too, know what I mean?

						=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
					- Let's hear it!
						GROWTH: What are you, some kind of sick freak? Did you think I was gonna just blurt out a racial slur or antagonize a group of people or something?!
						GROWTH: Ay! Twitter! It's him, I've found him! He's the culprit!
						GROWTH: [shake rate=20 level=10]Get him![/shake]

					GROWTH: Hey, what the heck? What's wrong with you? I was joking!
					GROWTH: You're sick.
					- I didn't mean it.
						GROWTH: Let's just move on. I'm ashamed to be associated with you right now.
						=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
					- I regret nothing. I am a complete deviant and a horrible monster.
						GROWTH: The dev coded in an automated process which triggers upon clicking that response; Several things just occurred:
						GROWTH: 1. If you have a webcam, it took a photo. 2. The game captured a screenshot and saved it in a hidden file. 3. If you are connected to the internet, it is uploading that screenshot to Twitter using the dev's login info.
						GROWTH: 4. You have been reported to the FBI. 5. Your mom has been notified of your monstrousness. 6. Your dad was notified but he just said "That's my boy," so all of this will be happening to him, too.
						GROWTH: 7. And some other stuff, it isn't really that important.
						GROWTH: Uh... 8. ...
						GROWTH: Well, #12 summarized your life for the next Netflix criminal documentary script, I think?
						GROWTH: And beyond that, er...? I don't really remember.
						=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
			- That was a long time ago! She is way too old for you.
				GROWTH: Oh. Shoot! That's a good point. What does she look like now?
				- They nerfed her physical qualities.
					GROWTH: Life truly isn't worth living.
					GROWTH: Let's just move on, this is getting weird.
					=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
				- She's fictional; she looks the same.
					[shake rate=20 level=10]GROWTH[/shake]: [speed=2][shake rate=20 level=10]THEN WHAT AM I WAITING FOR?![/shake]
					GROWTH: Oh, wait...? I thought I had a reason for talking to you in the first place. Not to hookup with Samus.
					GROWTH: Uh... Oh! That's right! We need your help.

			GROWTH: Those [b]bastards.[/b]
			GROWTH: Truly devilish, abhorrent activities on their part.
			GROWTH: Do you think I'd have a shot if I made a Samus movie which would be apart of the Nintendo Cinematic Universe?
			- Sure, buddy.
				GROWTH: Hey, don't call me that! That's what I'm supposed to call you when the dev thinks he's pulled one over on you!
				- Maybe I pulled one over on you!
					GROWTH: You freakin freaker.

						GROWTH: Man, get outta here!
						GROWTH: Let's move on already!
						=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
				- I don't like you!
					GROWTH: Dude, do you mean that? I wasn't being serious. Are you okay? Did I go too far somewhere?
					- I wasn't being serious, either.
						GROWTH: Oh, --oh! Ahah! Okay! Yeah!
						GROWTH: Scibbidydibbidy dabbidy doo. Yippityyappity yickity yee.
						GROWTH: It's starting to get awkward in here, dude! I think it's time that I make like a tree! (And leave!)

						GROWTH: Now you just sound like a crazy person. Do you honestly believe that? Or are you just trying to get me to shut up?
						- Let's move on, please.
							GROWTH: Sounds good to me!
							GROWTH: Look, the reason I came to you in the first place is that we need your help!

						- Who am I to say what has the qualities of life or what doesn't?
							GROWTH: That's totally fair!
							GROWTH: But I think in my case it is safe to say that I am not alive. I've just been talking for talking's sake, buddy!
							GROWTH: Anyway, hehe...
							=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
				- No. To be human is to be born on Earth, outside of a computer.
					GROWTH: I appreciate that you are placing yourself on an equal level as "animals"! Truly futuristic of you!
					- I did not mean to.
						GROWTH: Oh. Are humans not animals?
						- Of course they aren't.
							GROWTH: No. Of course they [b]are[/b]. You and animals both come from the same place, buddy! You're all in it together!
							GROWTH: The only thing we can be sure of in this discussion is that [b]I[/b] am not an animal!
							GROWTH: Sucker. You lil animal, you!
							GROWTH: Oink, oink!
							GROWTH: [shake rate=20 level=10]Neigh![/shake]
							GROWTH: Anyway, hehe...
							=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
						- They are, but we have evolved beyond the rest of them.
							GROWTH: That's a bit arrogant, don't you think, buddy?
							GROWTH: Birds have been around since the Jurassic age, man! That's 60 million years, at [b]least[/b]! What makes you better than a bird?
							- I have consciousness.
								GROWTH: You're a bit biased with this question, aren't you? You're the one with "consciousness", so of course it's better to have it than to not.
								GROWTH: Well, think about this! Jellyfish, one of the oldest species of animal on the planet, [b]do not get sad![/b] No depression at all! Wouldn't it be better on that basis to not have consciousness?
								GROWTH: Jellyfish have been around for at least [shake rate=20 level=10]500 million years.[/shake] In the freaking [b]OCEAN[/b]!!! That place is cuttthroat to say the least!
								GROWTH: Look, all I'm saying is that animals like you have been around for so long that you are all as valid as each other. You are as evolved as the next species, aren't you?
								- Feeling sad is a good thing. It reinforces groups and safety and stuff like that.
									GROWTH: Oh, whatever. One man's trash is another man's treasure.
									GROWTH: Anyway...
									=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
								- That's an interesting perspective.
									GROWTH: Yeah, man! You are literally the [b]cream[/b] of the freakin [b]crop![/b] All of your ancestors had babies that had babies that had babies that eventually led to [shake rate=20 level=10]you![/shake]
									GROWTH: But the same goes with every animal. You're all the best at what you've historically done in the past.
									GROWTH: P.S. -- Don't go trying to live like a jellyfish to prove a point, now, you hear?
									GROWTH: Okay, jeez--

							- I am no better than a bird.
								GROWTH: That's what's up! I respect the humility, man!
								GROWTH: Ahah... Anyway...
								=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
					- Well, it's true!
						GROWTH: Hey, I respect the humility, man!
						GROWTH: Ahah... Anyway...
						=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
	- Sure.
		GROWTH: Sure is right!
		GROWTH: Or are you just trying to get me to shut up?
		- Yeah, let's move on with our lives.
			GROWTH: Totally true.
			=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
		- No!
			GROWTH: Uh...
			GROWTH: Oh.
			=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
- A creation of God.
	GROWTH: Oh, boy.
	GROWTH: One could argue that most things aren't worth talking about, right?
	GROWTH: But "God" is certainly one of the most pointless things to talk about. Do you agree?
	- Sure.
		GROWTH: Alright, then.
		GROWTH: Uh...
		=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
	- No!
		GROWTH: Sorry, could you repeat yourself?
		- No!
			GROWTH: Oh, uh--okay?
			GROWTH: I guess... let's just move on, then.
			=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
		- Yes!
			GROWTH: Well, then, do it!
			- No!
				GROWTH: Wh-huh?!
				GROWTH: Uherrr... Alrighty!
				=> lore_intro_what_were_we_talking_about
			- Yes!
				GROWTH: What?
				GROWTH: Wait, sorry, I'm confused.
